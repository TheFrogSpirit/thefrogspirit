                    <h3>Conversation with one's self through writing</h3>
                    <p>In the Frog Cult, we believe that each individual frogs and people have to spend time building a bond with themselves.
                    <br>Or else, the heart gets lonely as we don't pay attention to it. We feel like we are lonely because we don't get to 
                    <br>talk to others and others don't understand us. In reality, we don't talk to ourselves and we don't understand 
                    <br>ourselves. The source of our loneliness is in our hearts, it wishes to communicate with us ever since we are born.
                    <br>
                    <br>One of the easiest ways to communicate with our heart is to write a question on piece of paper. Let your hand 
                    <br>answer you back with whatever comes to your mind first. Let it flow and trust in yourself. It may not feel right
                    <br>in the beginning, but every bond begins like a plant. The more you spend time watering and caring for it, the 
                    <br>better it becomes and one day - it will give you its fruit.
                    <br>
                    <br>In the case of our heart, it will offer you wisdom and insight beyond your expectations. That is why it is preferable
                    <br>to start paying attention to your core. After some time, you will not feel as lonely as before and you will not need
                    <br>any external influence to keep you happy. Once your roots are strong, your heart and mind will be in harmony. This 
                    <br>whole thing can be achieved by just communicating with yourself - we highly recommend you to have a dialogue on a paper.

                    <h3>Being cautious about the Seed of Actions</h3>
                    <p>
                        "History is not a dead fact<br>
                        It is a living organism" -<br>
                        A wise man<br><br>

                    Seed of actions is a phenomenon that is probably as old as time. In simple words, it can be described<br>
                    as an action or cause, that will have a long-lasting effect. Almost the same as a frog giving birth to<br> 
                    a new frog, each action will produce an effect, which would change the course of the next actions.<br><br>
                    
                    To understand this notion, we need to know what "time" is. Time is an order of this realm which deals<br> 
                    with the sequence of actions. Seed of actions affect not just individuals within one lifetime, it directly<br>
                    and strongly affects lineage and those frogs around the individuals.<br><br>
                    
                    In the beginning, there will be thoughts, they come together to form a decision, the decision becomes<br> 
                    a cause, and the cause becomes aneffect. It is similar to chess - there are no right or wrong moves,<br> 
                    there are only good and bad moves. If the move was good, your next position will have a strong advantage,<br>
                    if not, then it's the other way around.<br><br>
                    
                    When it comes to the seed of actions, whatever seed you plant, you will get a result in the coming<br> 
                    days, weeks, months, years, and generations - what goes in, goes out. If you are feeling happy or feeling<br> 
                    miserable, it helps to think and remember the roots of the effect that you are experiencing.<br> 
                    Who implanted the actions, which affected you to have your current state. Once you figure out the<br>
                    roots of the effect, you will be able to fix or prolong the effect in any way you wish.<br><br>
                      
                    In life, there are only three truths, Birth, Death and Seed of Actions. Anything else is debatable.<br> 
                    Each living being carries the three in their body. The three are actually one. let's imagine,<br> 
                    your great grandfather didn't go to school, but he knew the importance of knowledge and discipline.<br> 
                    So, he sent your grandfather to school despite all the work and hardship. That choice was a good seed of<br>
                    action which resulted positively on the future of his descendants. Your grandfather had a good life and<br> 
                    sent your father to school. It was a seed from the previous action. Today, you are living well, <br>
                    thanks to the good deeds of your forefathers.  <br><br>
                    
                    Any poor choice will bring bad consenquences to you, to people around you and those who will come after <br>
                    you. Actions such as hurting people and animals physically or emotionally, polluting the nature and <br>
                    disrespecting fire. This perspective gives much more insight into life and it will help you<br> 
                    to understand your situation better so that you can make better decisions in the future. It might sound<br> 
                    like something simple, but this is one of the foundational concepts of life, that should be taken seriously<br>
                    :)
