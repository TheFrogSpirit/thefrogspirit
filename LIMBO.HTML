                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                <p>                    
                    Just as stars shine brighter at night, Batman's video series "Limbo" was born from his procrastination. <br>
                    It all started when he was procrastinating with making videos for over a year. He wanted to share his humor  <br>
                    alongside his passion for rhetoric on YouTube. His friends have been encouraging him to make<br>
                    online contents, and one day - Batman spontaneously decided to make a low budget video for his friends, <br>
                    a parody of Inception, in honor to his procrastination.<br><br> 
                    <i>(This series contains movie parodies and hidden innapropriate jokes)</i>

                    The storyline was inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/yJfGcKwuz3o" target="_blank"> "The Fool's Journey" </a> based on Tarot deck. Each episode corresponds to <br>
                    one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Arcana" target="_blank">Major Arcana</a> card starting from 0 to 21. In the episode 0, Batman<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fool_(Tarot_card)" target="_blank">(The Fool)</a> begins his journey<br>
                    when he postpones his duty by taking a nap within a nap within another nap. That is how he enters Limbo,<br>
                    where he will encounter different figures, who will teach him fundamentals of rhetoric. However,<br>
                    most of the plots and dialogues are random and bizarre, due to the nature of the dream world. <br><br>

                    <i>(Rhetoric can be described as an ancient art of thinking and speaking. We need to learn how people think,<br>
                    in order to persuade minds of people and reach their hearts. Philosophy is used to find, learn<br>
                    and understand life, which can be considered as an input. Rhetoric is used to effectively deliver<br>
                    the ideas to others, it acts as an output. If there is any superman among us, then it's the person,<br>
                    who balanced these two arts/disciplines.)</i>

                    The first episode's structure is inspired by works of Plato, where he often has a dialogue with Socrates.<br>
                    Batman's initial idea was to interview Socrates, but that seemed neither silly nor authentic. So,<br>
                    he had to think of another person, who is known for being a famous  figure among public speakers,<br>
                    in his opinion, the best choice seemed to be - Alois Schicklgruber, aka Adolf Hitler.<br><br>

                    The meanings of the subtitles and the German speech mostly don't correspont, sometimes they contradict<br>
                    each other. All three layers(Batman, Hitler in German, Hitler's subtitles) have their own random jokes with<br>
                    historical references and movie parodies(Matrix, <a href="https://youtu.be/TQhns5AwAkA" target="_blank"> Invictus</a>)
                    <br><br>
                    The Fuhrer<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magician_(Tarot_card)" target="_blank">(The Magician I)</a>
                        offers the golden lesson of rhetoric - <i>know the audience.</i> <br>
                    This is the most crucial thing to prepare before starting any conversation - by knowing the values and <br>
                    level of understandings of our listener, we adjust our speech, so that our words become highly effective.<br>
                    The more we know about the other person, the better. The mind of our listeners will be more open to our<br>
                    our ideas and our words will be one step closer to their hearts.

                    in the previous layer of nap. He talks about his procrastination, which gets interrupted by a YouTube ad.<br>

                    <i>importance of credibility, which is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethos" target="_blank">Ethos</a>.</i> <br>
                    It is one of the three pillars of rhetoric, alongside Pathos and Logos. 
                    <br><br>
                    People would always listen and accept words coming from people who they can trust, because those <br>
                    "trusted" people have a solid background. Remember the story of a girl who shouted "wolves" 3 times, <br>
                    the villagers didn't come the third time as they had thought that she was lying. That is why it is highly <br>
                    recommended to establish an emotional or logical credibility before or in the beginning of speeches.<br>
                    For example, you can mention about your background that is related to topic, maybe something which <br>
                    the audience could accept you as someone knowleadgable or as someone who they can relate to.<br>

                Batman takes a nap again, in which he sees nightmares of Serbian-Albanian football match. An Albanian<br>
                nationalist devil whispers in his ears a few politically biased words. He ends up in Limbo again, but <br>
                this time, he is in the Limbo of nightmares. This was a blessing in disguice, as he gets a chance to <br>
                confront his darkness, which bothered him from inside. 
                <br><br>
                Within the chamber of emotions, he sees Froggie rampaging Batman's inner world. Froggie sings a song <br>
                called <a href="https://youtu.be/oRKQcNq9wp8" target="_blank">Sonsii</a>(let me hear) with throatsinging. Mona Lisa speaks to Batman, saying that a carrot is required<br>
                to make friends with Froggie. Mona Lisa<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empress_(Tarot_card)" target="_blank">(The Empress III)</a> shows that a small act of kindness can turn<br> 
                anger into love. 
                <br><br>
                Batman talks with Froggie in a civil way and they discuss problems related to emotions. Batman confesses <br>
                that emotions are difficult for him to understand. They talk about the importance of emotions in public<br>
                speaking, which also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathos" target="_blank">Pathos</a>. The effect of carrot wears off and Froggie becomes grumpy again.
                <br><br>
                I assume most of us(me included) like to believe that we are intellectual, rational beings, who make <br>
                decisions based on logical thinking. Probably this way of seeing ourselves further detaches us from <br>
                from our true nature. Public speakers usually tend to believe that we are all emotional and instinctive<br>
                beings. We should target and focus on the emotion of our listeners, because when the right emotion is <br>
                triggered, people become more willing to listen. It doesn't mean we have to always speak emotionally, <br>
                but our main message has to have a bit of an emotional flavor to increase the effectiveness of our speeches.

                The Episode 4 begins with flashbacks of Batman's childhood in a wizarding school. <i>(he was raised up with<br>
                Harry Potter books, films and games)</i>. Then fast forwards to present story, when Froggie challenges Batman<br>
                to a wizarding duel. Froggie immediately kills Batman with the forbidden spell - Avada Kedavra. <br><br>

                Batman wakes up at the King's Cross station and notices a dying horcrux of Froggie under a bench. Then, <br>
                a rooster shows up and starts talking to Batman. Batman cracks a joke or two and gets interrupted by <br>
                a breaking news. Afterwards, the rooster<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor_(Tarot_card)" target="_blank">(The Emperor IV)</a> 
                teaches an important aspect of rhetoric - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethos" target="_blank">Logos</a>. <br><br>
                
                The rooster explains that people like to think that they approach life logically. So, we need to adjust<br>
                our words with structures and arguments, that fits the logical thinking of our listeners. When we present<br>
                our speech with a clear structure and valid arguments for our audience, it becomes much easier for them <br>
                to digest the ideas we are trying to deliver. <i>(These tips may sound simple and obvious, but they are <br>
                often overlooked.)</i>

                and he travelled in his inner world. Strangely, he was pulled to the core of earth by a strange <br>
                force. He sank deep down to ocean, earth, lava and ended up in a dark world, where he met the spirit <br>
                of the Mother Earth. She asked for help, as she said that she won't last long at this rate. Batman <br>
                felt sad and helpess, but then he decided to dedicate a Limbo episode for this cause, as it's the only <br>
                thing he is good at.)</i>
                <br><br>
                It begins with Batman and the rooster at the King's Cross station. The rooster tells Batman to go to the<br>
                place with the one tree and gives him a small guitar. Batman takes the guitar and sings "I'm Goofy Goober<br>
                Rock". Shortly, he meets master Bruce Lee underneath the tree and tells how he ended up there. Bruce Lee<br>
                explains that Batman is on the verge of life and death, the only way out is to go into the heart shaped <br>
                pond.<br><br>

                While descending into the water, Batman sees two deers<i>(a reference Buddha's story after enlightenment).</i><br>
                They say "moo", like cows, which surprises Batman. Then, he sees a sunken ship, covered in flowers, on the <br>
                bottom of the sea. Batman goes into the ship and he meets the Holy Teacher Buddha(The Hierophant V).<br>
                <i>(Batman had a dream of seeing Buddha's statue in a sunken ship covered by flowers)</i><br><br>

                Buddha cracks a lot of jokes, but also offers an invaluable advice to Batman - when presenting speeches,<br>
                it is highly preferable to have a goodwill for others and think about what benefits our audience will get <br>
                from listening to us. That is one of the strongest forces to convince/persuade others and mobilize people. <br>
                <i>(Now, these tips may sound like advice for manipulation, but argumentation, persuasion, manipulation<br>
                are all the same thing, with slightly different connotations. They surround us everyday in society, any <br>
                conversation between family, friends, teachers, poems, songs, books, movies, ads and many others contain<br>
                argumentantions. "Good" or "Bad" all depends on who uses them and how we see them.)</i>
                <br><br>
                When Batman asks how to get out, Buddha advices to go into another, a bit darker, heart shaped pond <br>
                Batman goes into the water and meets Ugandan Knuckles. When Batman lands on the bottom, he sees <br>
                another heart shaped pond, but this time its completely dark. He guesses that probably this is the only<br>
                way out and dives in.<br>
                <br>
                While falling further down, he listens to lullaby melody, the melody that is engraved in his heart. <br>
                Batman sees a land with a picture of himself and Froggie together<i>(a reference to Kingdom Hearts).</i><br>
                When he descends on the canvas of his heart, he sees a bright greenish light. It turns out to be his <br>
                plant Harambe from his previous video about the Mongolian language. Harambe asks for help and says <br>
                that there is not enough time left. The light of Harambe goes into Batman and becomes part of his heart.<br>
                <br>
